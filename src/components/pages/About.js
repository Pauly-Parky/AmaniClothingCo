                            <p>Amani Clothing Co. was founded on the idea that all should strive to make the earth a better place. We stand firm behind the belief that everyone has the capability to spread love and create positivity. So have a little faith and come join us, in our journey to change the world one step at a time.</p>
                            <p>MISSION STATEMENT: Our beloved gentle giants are in danger. At Amani Clothing Co., we seek to bring peace and serenity for these beautiful creatures in every way possible, which is why we have devoted a portion of all proceeds to be donated to the Giraffe Conservation Foundation (GCF); a non-profit organization that is dedicated to support the conservation of giraffes, their habitats, and overall well-being.</p>
                            <p>VISION: “Amani” means “peace” in Swahili, which is the native language of Africa. The majority of giraffes roam freely in the central, eastern and southern parts of Africa. However, over the last 30 years, the population of these animals have shrunk by an astounding forty percent. Poaching and fragmentation are the main reasons for their endangerment. We envision a world where these graceful beings can roam free. #FreetheGentleGiants</p>
